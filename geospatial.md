#About
{: #about}


You use the {{site.data.keyword.geospatialshort_Geospatial}} service to monitor when devices are entering or leaving locations that you specify. You can also detect whether a device has been within a region longer than a specified dwell time (Hangout Detection). After you start the service, the monitor is on and the service receives device information continuously from the MQTT message broker. When you stop the service, monitoring turns off.

Billions of connected devices are in the Internet of Things, with forecasts that predict steep growth rates in coming years. That's many objects to track. Awareness of the location of devices on-the-move opens up a number of exciting new application opportunities.

* Offering real-time promotions to customers who are near specific retail locations.
* Alerting cars or other connected devices of regions to avoid, for example, where accidents or emergency situations occurred.


The easiest way to get started with geospatial device monitoring is to use the [starter application ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/build-real-time-location-monitoring-application-ibm-cloud-geospatial-analytics-node-js/){:new_window}. This Node.js starter application shows you how to configure and control the {{site.data.keyword.geospatialshort_Geospatial}} service through its REST API. You can also modify the application code and push your changes back to the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environment.
